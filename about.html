            <p class="aboutPara">The Student Union on the old RIT campus was located in 
              a converted house on 90 Troup Street.  This house had elaborate features 
              such as a large staircase, stained glass windows, and buzzer system to ring 
              for servants.  The first floor was used as a meeting space and had the first 
              color television set on campus, while the second floor hosted WITR (RIT’s 
              radio station) and Religious Affairs.  After RIT left downtown, this building 
              was demolished to make room for the Inner Loop.
