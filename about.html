            <h5>90 Troup Street</h5>
            <div class="buildingInfo">
            <p class="aboutPara">The Student Union on the old RIT campus was located in 
              a converted house on 90 Troup Street.  This house had elaborate features 
              such as a large staircase, stained glass windows, and buzzer system to ring 
              for servants.  The first floor was used as a meeting space and had the first 
              color television set on campus, while the second floor hosted WITR (RIT’s 
              radio station) and Religious Affairs.  After RIT left downtown, this building 
              was demolished to make room for the Inner Loop.

              <div class="buildingInfo">
              <p class="aboutPara">Originally the Manager Rochester Hotel, this building was 
                purchased by Rochester Institute of Technology in 1957 and opened as the men’s 
                dormitory building in 1959.  The building mostly housed first-year students, 
                since many people moved into apartments and off-campus after their first year.  
                NRH had the capability to house over 400 students. It remained in use until the 
                campus' move to Henrietta in 1968, and the building was later demolished.

                  <div class="buildingInfo">
                  <p class="aboutPara">Kate Gleason Hall was the women’s dormitory building on the old 
                    RIT campus.  It was built in the early 1940s on land donated by Kate Gleason, a 
                    major donor for the institution.  The building was six stories, and each dorm 
                    had kitchenettes for the female students to use.  When the school moved to 
                    Henrietta in 1968, this building was demolished in order to make room for the Inner Loop.

                  <div class="buildingInfo">
                  <p class="aboutPara">Built in 1946, this building was constructed with funds donated by 
                    RIT trustee George H. Clark in order to meet the school’s needs post WWII.  The Clark 
                    Building housed the Mechanical Department, Engineering, Photography, Publishing, and 
                    Printing Programs, as well as the offices for The Reporter (school newspaper) and 
                    Techmilla (school yearbook).  After RIT’s move, the building was sold to the Rochester 
                    City School district.  It still stands; however, it has been significantly remodeled 
                    since when RIT owned it.

                <h3>Bevier Memorial Building</h3>
                  <h5>42 South Washington Street</h5>
                  <div class="buildingInfo">
                  <p class="aboutPara">The Bevier Memorial Building was built 1910, using funds donated by 
                    Susan Bevier.  It was built on the site of Colonel Nathaniel Rochester’s home, and 
                    opened for use in late 1911.  The building hosted the School of Art and Design, as 
                    well as the Bevier Gallery.  Despite efforts to demolish the building after RIT’s 
                    move from downtown, the building was put on the National Register of Historic Places 
                    in 1973, and has been privately owned since 1978.  Today, the building has office 
                    spaces and apartments.
